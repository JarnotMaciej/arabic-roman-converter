# To-Do

- [ ] scope of the final projects no. 1-4 (model, tests, web application),
- [ ] database exceptions handling,
- [ ] documentation (Javadoc) - description of all classes, methods, fields, and packages (including unit tests),
- [ ] documentation (Javadoc) - mandatory tags: @author, @version, @param, @return, @throws,
- [ ] System.out.println clean up
- [ ] deleting stuff from db + clearing cookies :D

---

# Doing

- [ ] database connection should be established only once for the run of the application,

---

# Done

- [x] automatic database schema creation on the first run of the application,
- [x] ability to see all database records through the web application,
- [x] database support using JDBC or JPA,
- [x] storing the history of performed operations in the database,
- [x] Java naming convention and English identifiers.
- [x] web application with unit tests of the model and access to the model (scope of prototypes 2 and 4)

--- 

# Notes
Just replacing history, instead of session the db would be used -> create and insert operation.
